This [week](/wdwdw) we’ll **take** Camera & lighting. Nanjala Media manages the total esthetics of camera movement, lighting, action, scene arrangement, and sound recording. • Directs camera so as to reflect the subject material as envisioned in the end product. \*.



## Animations

Coordinates with animation department or animation vendor for accomplishment of animated scenes, titles and other work.

Audiovisual for slide film presentations. Production techniques are similar to motion picture productions except that the end product is still pictures in slide form with accompanying sound cassettes. 
Slide film productions are most suitable for training and self-paced learning and, as such, requires the development, writing and printing of coordinated workbooks which the viewer is instructed to use with the slide presentation. 
Nanjala Media directs the transfer of these productions to the video tape format where requested.


Location.  Productions are performed via satellite, virtually or on location. We carefully considers customs when producing in foreign countries.

Obtains properties required in studio or on location; makes all arrangements for production including services of augmented production crew, special equipment, props and acting talent.
