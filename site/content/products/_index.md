        Nanjala Media determines the appropriate method of coverage based on 
        communications goals and objectives for the project, location, environment, and 
        available time and resources. A final production review is conducted by the Nanjala 
        Media for proper and sufficient use of established motion picture production 
        techniques and evidence of the creative ability required in communicating information through television.
